# House Robbing 

This Java project implements a **binary tree representation of houses** for the "House Robber" problem, often encountered in algorithm studies. Each node in the tree represents a house with a certain amount of money. The goal is to **maximize the amount of money stolen** without robbing two directly connected houses (parent and child).


## Features

- **Binary Tree Implementation**  
  Houses are represented as nodes in a binary tree (`TreeNode`), and a level-order insertion is used to populate the tree.

- **Tree Visualization**  
  Prints the binary tree level by level, making it easy to visualize the arrangement of houses.

- **House Robbing Algorithm**  
  Includes a placeholder for the dynamic programming solution (`rob(TreeNode node)`) to calculate the maximum amount of money that can be robbed while respecting the rule of not robbing adjacent houses.
